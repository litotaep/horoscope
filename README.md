### Font / Typography

This application uses the UrbanSlavic font for UI elements.  
- If you want the exact visual appearance, install the *UrbanSlavic* font on your system before running the app.  
- If the font is not installed, the app will fall back to a default system font (e.g. Arial).

License & source: Do not include the font file in this repository unless the font's license permits redistribution. Get UrbanSlavic from the original source: https://fonts-online.ru/fonts/urbanslavic and follow the installation instructions for your OS.
